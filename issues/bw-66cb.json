  "description": "bd has 'dep tree' — an issue-centric dependency tree rooted at a single issue. Walks edges recursively with direction control (up/down/both), max-depth, status filtering. Our 'bw graph \u003cid\u003e' shows the connected component as a layered DAG but lacks direction control and tree-depth perspective. Decide whether to add 'bw dep tree' as a separate subcommand or extend 'bw graph \u003cid\u003e' with direction/depth flags.",
