  "description": "Intent-based commit messages lose data during conflict replay. The critical issue is ID divergence on create (replay generates a new ID, so subsequent intents referencing the original ID fail). Secondary issues: start/defer/undefer verbs silently dropped, close reason lost, description not encoded, multi-word title in update breaks on spaces, escaped quotes in titles corrupt parsing. Add tests that expose each gap, then fix the generation and replay code.",
