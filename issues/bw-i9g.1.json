  "description": "findGitDir() shells out to 'git rev-parse --git-common-dir' on every invocation — it's the first thing FindRepo() does. Replace with a pure-Go implementation that walks up from cwd looking for .git (file or directory). If .git is a file (worktree), read it to extract the gitdir path, then read commondir from there. This removes the single biggest exec.Command from the hot path.\n\nTDD: write tests first covering — normal repo (.git dir), worktree (.git file pointing elsewhere), nested directory, no repo (error), commondir resolution.",
