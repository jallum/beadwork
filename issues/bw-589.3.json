  "description": "Create the test infrastructure for binary-level tests. Build the bw binary, create a temp git repo with fixed config (user.name, user.email), set BW_CLOCK and GIT_AUTHOR_DATE/GIT_COMMITTER_DATE for full determinism. Run bw commands via exec, capture output. Compare bw export output against golden files. A failing test is a diff. Updating after intentional changes is a file copy. This can be a Go test in a new test/ directory or a dedicated _test.go in cmd/bw/.",
