  "description": "Remove the bw graph command entirely (cmd/bw/graph.go, graph_test.go). Its functionality is replaced by the BLOCKED BY / BLOCKS sections in show.\n\nRemove from command registry in command.go. Remove the 'Dependencies' command group or rename it if 'dep' still lives there alone.\n\nAlso remove Store.Graph() and GraphNode type from internal/issue/issue.go — the shared primitives (loadEdges, walkTips) replace them. Update any callers of Graph() if they exist outside the graph command.",
