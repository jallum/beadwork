  "description": "bw show \u003cid\u003e renders the wrong issue ID in the BLOCKED BY section. For bw-u24.1, the JSON (--json) correctly shows blocked_by: [\"bw-u24.5\"], but the human-readable display shows \"BLOCKED BY → ○ bw-u24.2\" — a completely different issue. This is the most dangerous of the three because it gives confidently wrong information and can send someone chasing problems that don't exist (e.g., a circular dependency that wasn't real).",
