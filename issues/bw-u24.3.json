  "description": "Three format mismatches between generation and replay: (1) close reason is formatted as reason=%q but replayClose always passes empty string — parse and forward it. (2) update description is encoded as literal 'description=...' — encode the actual value (quoted) and add case 'description' to replayUpdate. (3) update defer is encoded as 'defer=\u003cdate\u003e' but replayUpdate has no case for it — add handling for defer key. Also handle DeferUntil in create intent for issues created with --defer.",
