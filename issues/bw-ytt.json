  "description": "The flat list from bw ready doesn't distinguish epics from their children. When an agent is asked to work on an epic, they have to cross-reference with bw show to understand which ready items belong to it. Change the text output to indent child issues (those with a Parent field) under their parent, with a blank line between groups. Standalone issues (no parent) appear at the top level. JSON output is unchanged — it stays a flat array since each issue already carries its parent field.",
