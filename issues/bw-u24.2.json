  "description": "These three verbs generate intents but have no replay handler — they hit the default case and return nil. Add replayStart (parse assignee, call store.Start), replayDefer (parse date, update status+DeferUntil), replayUndefer (clear DeferUntil, set status=open). Without these, started issues revert to open and deferred issues lose their dates after conflict replay.",
