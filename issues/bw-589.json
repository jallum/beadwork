  "description": "Add a new testing layer that exercises the built bw binary end-to-end. Create a git repo, run CLI commands, and diff bw export against golden files. Requires two tool changes to make state fully deterministic: explicit --id on create, and a clock override for timestamps. With IDs and timestamps fixed, git hashes become deterministic too (given controlled git config and GIT_AUTHOR_DATE/GIT_COMMITTER_DATE).",
