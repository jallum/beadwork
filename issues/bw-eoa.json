  "description": "bw start currently prints a minimal 'started \u003cid\u003e' line. Enhance it to show full issue context (summary, description, children, dependency map, comments) plus a 'LANDING THE WORK' section rendered from a new start.md template. This moves per-task conditional workflow hints (PR review, etc.) out of prime.md and into the point-of-action briefing where they're most useful. Prime.md gets slimmed and restructured to focus on the mental model rather than procedure.",
