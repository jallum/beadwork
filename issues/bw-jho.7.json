  "description": "prime.go builds the 'Current State' section into a strings.Builder then passes it through styleMD as one blob. Since styleMD is line-by-line, write directly to w instead — apply styleMD per line (or use w.Style inline) and use Push/Pop for the indented issue listings. Eliminates the '  ' and '    └' hardcoded prefixes.",
