  "description": "When creating an issue with --parent, generate the ID as parent.N (e.g., bw-abc.1) instead of an independent random ID. The dotted format is cosmetic — a human-readable hint. The ID is permanent even if the parent link is later severed. Requires a child counter per parent (max existing child number + 1). Depends on bw-57f5 (base36 IDs).",
