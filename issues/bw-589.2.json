  "description": "Replace direct time.Now() calls in internal/issue/ with a Store.Now() method that checks for a BW_CLOCK env var. If set (RFC3339 value), all timestamp generation uses that fixed time instead of the real clock. Affects: create.go, update.go, blocking.go, label.go, comment.go. The treefs layer (git commit signatures) should also respect this — either through the same env var or by threading a clock into TreeFS.Commit/MergeCommit.",
