  "description": "Write the first end-to-end scenario: create issues with --id, wire dependencies, add labels, progress through statuses (start, close, defer), add comments, then bw export and diff against a golden .jsonl file. Second phase: import the export into a fresh repo and verify round-trip. This proves the full CLI pipeline — flag parsing, command dispatch, storage, and export formatting — against a known-good baseline.",
