  "description": "In ready.go's cmdReady (or by enriching Store.Ready()), partition the ready issues into groups: issues with a Parent are grouped under that parent, issues without a parent stand alone at the top level. The parent issue itself may or may not be in the ready list — if it is, it becomes the group header; if not, it still needs to be loaded to serve as the header. Return or organize the data so the rendering loop can iterate group-by-group.",
