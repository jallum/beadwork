  "description": "Replace 'bw comments add \u003cid\u003e \"text\"' with 'bw comment \u003cid\u003e \"text\"'. The subcommand structure adds nothing — 'add' is the only action, and listing comments is already covered by 'bw show'. Three tokens for a single action, and agents reliably get the plural wrong ('bw comment' instead of 'bw comments'). Drop the subcommand, promote to top-level. Update: prompts/prime.md (line 79), prompts/agents.md if applicable, README, and command help text.",
