      "text": "Implemented inline dependency display in list, ready, and blocked output. Added formatDeps helper in helpers.go that renders [blocks: ...] and [blocked by: ...] suffixes. Updated list.go, ready.go, and blocked.go to append dependency info. For blocked.go, also added a 'Blocks:' line when a blocked issue itself blocks others. Updated existing tests in scenario_test.go and cli_test.go to use line-based issue ID checking (hasListedIssue/assertNotListedIssue) since dependency IDs now appear in output. Added comprehensive new tests: 5 formatDeps unit tests, 3 list dep tests, 2 ready dep tests, and 2 blocked dep tests.",
