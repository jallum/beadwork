  "description": "cmdUpdate encodes title=My New Title (no quoting), but ParseIntent splits on spaces, so replayUpdate sees title=My as one token and New, Title as orphans. Same problem for assignee with spaces. Either quote values containing spaces in the intent (title=\"My New Title\") or switch update intents to a format that handles spaces (e.g. key=%q). Also fix ExtractQuoted / ParseIntent to handle Go %q escape sequences (backslash-quote) so round-tripping works.",
