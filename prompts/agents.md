## Issue Tracking

This project tracks work with `bw` (beadwork), which persists to git — it survives compaction, session boundaries, and context loss. Prefer it over in-memory task tracking.

If you don't have context about current work — new session, compaction, or just unsure — run `bw prime`. It shows the workflow, your current issues, and where things left off.

Start with `bw ready` to find available work.
