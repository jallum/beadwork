# Changelog

## 0.11.3 — 2026-03-10

- **Bug fix: TTY line wrapping** — lines with dependency annotations (e.g. `[blocks: bw-xyz]`) wrapped prematurely because the wrap engine counted invisible color markers as visible width, overcounting each line by ~51 characters. Most visible on `bw ready` and `bw list` output with `blocks`/`blocked by` annotations.

## 0.11.2 — 2026-03-08

- **Git context in `bw prime` and `bw ready`** — output now shows the current branch, clean/dirty state, and last commit so agents know where they are without a separate `git status`.

- **`bw init` surfaces onboard instructions** — after initializing, `bw init` now tells you about `bw onboard` so new users discover agent integration setup immediately.

- **Standardized worktree branch naming** — the prime prompt now includes a naming convention (`<id>/<short-description>`, e.g. `bw-a1b/fix-auth-bug`) so agents produce consistent branch names.

- **Uncommitted changes warning** — `bw prime` and `bw ready` now warn when the working tree has uncommitted changes.

- **Styled open checkboxes** — TTY output uses `☐` (dimmed) for open checkboxes instead of `[ ]`, matching the `✓` styling for completed items.

- **Blocked status in `bw ready` legend** — the TTY legend now includes the blocked indicator.

- **Bug fix: `bw defer` relative dates** — inputs like "2 weeks" and "next monday" now parse correctly.

- **Bug fix: line wrapping** — bullet items and dependency annotations no longer break mid-word.

- **`--raw` renamed to `--x-raw`** — internal/debug flags now use an `--x-` prefix to distinguish them from stable flags.

## 0.11.1 — 2026-03-08

- **Styled upgrade changelog** — the release notes shown during `bw upgrade` now go through the same markdown rendering pipeline as `bw show` and `bw list`, gaining heading colorization, bold/code inline styling, and terminal-width wrapping.

## 0.11.0 — 2026-03-08

- **Markdown-native output** — `bw show`, `bw list`, `bw ready`, and `bw start` now emit semantic markdown with embedded tokens (`{status:open}`, `{id:bw-xyz}`, etc.) that resolve to styled ANSI on TTY, clean unicode in markdown mode, or raw tokens for debugging. This replaces the old Go template rendering pipeline. Use `--x-render-as tty|markdown|raw` to preview the different modes.

- **Rewritten prime prompt** — `bw prime` is shorter (~300 words, down from ~700) and structured around a delivery-awareness question: _"How should this land?"_ with three tiers — quick fix (no ticket), branch/PR (ticket + worktree), or multi-step (epic). The agent asks the user instead of guessing, which tested more reliably than blanket "every change gets a ticket" rules. Dirty worktree warnings now appear as a prominent `[!WARNING]` block at the top.

- **Agent-agnostic delegation** — the prime prompt no longer references Claude Code–specific tools like `isolation: "worktree"`. Instead it states consequences: _"Each delegated task needs its own worktree… Agents that can't request approvals can't land work — plan accordingly."_ Agents infer the right mechanism on their own. Tested 9/9 on both principle-based and explicit variants.

- **Agent detection** — new `internal/agent` package detects the invoking AI agent (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor) via environment variables, enabling agent-aware behavior in future commands.

- **Improved onboarding** — `bw onboard` now recommends adding the bootstrap prompt to `CLAUDE.md` (not `AGENTS.md`, which Claude Code doesn't read). References are agent-agnostic, mentioning `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `COPILOT.md`.

- **Bug fix: closed blockers no longer clutter output** — `bw list` dependency annotations now filter out already-closed blockers.

- **Repositioned as work management** — README reframed from "issue tracking" to "git-native work management." Added Discord community link.

- **Prompt design documentation** — new `docs/prompts/` directory with design requirements for each prompt (`prime.md`, `agents.md`, `start.md`) and a full experimentation methodology (`prompts.md`).

## 0.10.0 — 2026-03-06

- **Automatic upgrade notifications** — `bw` now checks for newer releases once per day (throttled via a local cache). When a new version is found, it creates a P1 upgrade bead with the changelog and instructions to run `bw upgrade`. The bead updates itself if further releases appear, and `bw upgrade` auto-closes it when complete. This runs silently in the background of any store-using command — no new flags or commands required.

- **`bw prime` now includes issue ID prefix** — the prime output resolves `{prefix}` placeholders so agents see the project's actual prefix (e.g., `bw-XYZ`) in the model description, reducing ambiguity about issue ID format.

- **Improved agent onboarding prompt** — the prime directive in `prompts/agents.md` now emphasizes that untracked/unlanded work is effectively void, better aligning with how agents actually lose context across sessions.

- **Project-level AGENTS.md** — replaced the symlink to `prompts/agents.md` with a standalone file describing beadwork's purpose, architecture, and repo structure for agents working on beadwork itself.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-02-28

- **`bw start` is now a full point-of-action briefing** — starting an issue prints type-aware guidance for both beginning and landing the work. Epics get "work through children via `bw ready`" while tasks and bugs get scoped commit steps. Children, dependencies, and comments are rendered inline from the template, so the briefing adapts to each issue type. Comments now always appear regardless of issue type (previously they were missing for non-standard types like `feature`).

- **`bw reopen` accepts in-progress issues** — you can now run `bw reopen` on an `in_progress` issue to reset it to `open` and clear the assignee, returning it to the ready queue without closing first. Useful when you need to unclaim work.

- **`bw ready` sorts by priority** — output is now ordered by priority (P0 first) then creation date, matching `bw list`. Previously the order was arbitrary.

- **`bw prime` shows work in progress** — the prime output now includes a "Work In Progress" section alongside ready work, so you can see what's already claimed at a glance.

- **`bw sync` no longer blocked by pre-push hooks** — the internal push for the beadwork data branch now skips user-configured hooks, which are irrelevant to the data branch and could block syncing.

- **`bw dep remove` errors on non-existent dependencies** — previously succeeded silently; now returns `"no dependency: A does not block B"`.

- **Fixed dependency display bugs** — `bw show` could display sibling issues in the BLOCKED BY section instead of only transitive blockers. `bw ready` and `bw list` showed closed blockers in annotations. Both are fixed.

- **Intent replay fixes** — `bw sync` conflict resolution now correctly replays `start`, `defer`, and `undefer` operations, preserves deterministic IDs during create replay, and encodes descriptions faithfully. These fixes improve reliability when syncing concurrent changes.

- **Improved prompts** — `bw prime` worktree guidance now names the scope-creep temptation ("that related fix is a new ticket") and embeds worktree creation into the "Starting the Work" workflow. `bw start` landing instructions include PR workflow guidance when applicable. Re-run `bw onboard` to pick up the new prompts.

- **Acceptance test harness** — golden-file acceptance tests verify end-to-end command sequences with deterministic state, including export/import round-trip fidelity.

## 0.8.1 — 2026-02-22

- **`bw show` header includes comment count** — the header bracket now shows how many comments an issue has (e.g., `· 3 comments`) or `· NO COMMENTS` when empty, so you can tell at a glance whether there's discussion without scrolling to the bottom.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-02-22

- **`bw start` now shows full issue context** — starting an issue prints the description, children, dependencies, comments, and a "Landing the Work" section with next steps. Delegates get the full picture without needing a separate `bw show`.

- **`bw ready` groups child issues under their parent** — epics and their children are visually grouped with indentation instead of appearing as a flat list. Standalone issues print first, followed by parent/child groups.

- **`bw show` displays children for epics** — a new CHILDREN section lists each child with status, priority, and inline dependency annotations. Use `--only children` to show just the children.

- **`bw comment` replaces `bw comments`** — simplified to a single verb: `bw comment <id> "text"`. The old `bw comments` still works as an alias. Listing comments has moved to `bw show` (which already displayed them).

- **`--dry-run` global flag** — run any command without committing changes to the beadwork branch. Shown in `bw --help` under Global Flags. Useful for previewing what a command would do.

- **Deterministic state for testing** — `bw create --id <ID>` pins the issue ID, and `BW_CLOCK=<RFC3339>` freezes timestamps. Together they make `bw export` output fully reproducible, enabling golden-file acceptance tests.

- **Faster startup** — removed `git` subprocess calls from the hot path (`findGitDir` and `gitUserName` replaced with pure-Go equivalents). Every `bw` invocation is faster, especially on macOS where subprocess startup carries SSH agent overhead.

- **Improved prompts** — `bw prime` and `bw onboard` now include guidance on delegating work to sub-agents, using worktrees, and closing out tickets after verification. If you've customized agent configuration, re-run `bw onboard` to pick up the new prompts.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-02-21

- **New `bw start` command** — claims and begins work on an issue in one step. Validates the issue is open and unblocked, moves it to `in_progress`, and assigns from `git config user.name` (or `--assignee`). If the issue has unresolved blockers, it shows the blocker titles and suggests `bw ready`. The `--assignee` flag has been removed from `bw create` — assignment now means active work, not planning.
- **Actionable tips in `bw show`** — dependency sections now walk the blocker tree to surface only the leaf issues that need work. If A←B←C←D, showing A displays only D. New BLOCKED BY and UNBLOCKS sections replace the old flat dependency lists. Use `--only` to filter output to specific sections (replaces `--short`).
- **`bw graph` removed** — its job is now done better by show's dependency sections.
- **`bw close` strikethroughs the title** for a visual "done" cue.
- **`bw prime` injects project state inline** — ready queue and issue counts now appear in context under "Finding and Doing Work" rather than appended at the end.
- **Reworked `bw prime` and `bw onboard` prompts** — prime now emphasizes landing the work (commit, close, sync) and connects issues to commits. The onboard prompt has also changed — if you've customized your agent configuration based on the old output, re-run `bw onboard` to pick up the new version.
- **Sync uses system git for network operations** — fixes SSH failures on macOS when the SSH agent has no loaded keys.
